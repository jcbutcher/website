---

Two long-standing colleagues died within a few days of each other:

- Mike Delves, a student in Auckland in the 1950s and later Professor of Computational Mathematics
at the University of Liverpool, died on 13 February 2011 from prostate cancer.

- Jan Verwer, whose career at the CWI was celebrated the previous month, died unexpectedly
on 16 February 2011.
