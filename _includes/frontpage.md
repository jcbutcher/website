### Research Interests

#### Ordinary differential equations

Numerical methods for the solution of ordinary differential equations (section 65L in Mathematical Reviews). $$\frac{d y}{d x} = f(y)$$ Within this broad area I work on a number of specialities some of which are listed below.

##### Runge-Kutta methods

$$
\begin{array}{c|cccc} c_1 & a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1s}\\ c_2 & a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2s}\\ \vdots & \vdots &\vdots & &\vdots \\ c_s & a_{s1} & a_{s2} & \cdots & a_{ss}\\ \hline & b_1 & b_2 & \cdots & b_s \end{array}
$$

##### General linear methods

$$
\begin{bmatrix} A & U\\ B & V \end{bmatrix}
$$

##### G-symplectic general linear methods

$$
\begin{bmatrix} DA + A^{\sf T} D - B ^{\sf T} G B & DU - B^{\sf T} G V\\ U^{\sf T}D - V^{\sf T} G B & G - V^{\sf T} G V \end{bmatrix}=0 
$$
