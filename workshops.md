title: Numerical Analyis Workshops
---

These workshops have been running for many years and afford an opportunity for academic staff and students, working in numerical analysis, to exchange ideas, practice conference or other presentations and to study publications by other people.

Recently, some members of the workshop who no longer live in Auckland, have linked up with meetings of the workshop using electronic communication techniques. Furthermore the workshop has held meetings in collaboration with groups of colleagues in other countries.

To obtain information on the current activities and plans for the workshop, please consult Angela Tsai (_[angela@math.auckland.ac.nz](mailto:angela@math.auckland.ac.nz)_)
